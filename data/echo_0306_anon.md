Hello Team!

We've successfully implemented the your suggested 8-sequential-prompt system with data sources, and I'm excited to report that I've uncovered some fascinating insights along the way! I can't wait to share these discoveries with you at our next meeting.

Before we push forward with this approach or suggest new possibilities, I'd love your expert eyes on the attached reports. Your feedback on our strengths and areas for improvement will help us refine our strategy and maximize our results going forward!

I've also attached the complete AI responses from each step of our process in the .rar file. This includes the full conversation history and outputs, which should provide you with valuable context about what happened at each stage of implementation.

Side note the file names should be Step 1 Result, Step 2 Result, etc.. instead of Prompt 1, Prompt 2 :sweat_smile:

thank you @KaelenH.! we'll take a look at this this week

@KaelenH. , thank you for update.  At first glance, I am not seeing a few things that we were and have been expecting from the spec. 1.) Balance of sources (the fact that the sources are drawn from disparate sources). It still reads very much from just covering things from the left.  2.) Timeliness. Seems like much of the crawling or sources are overly broad, and quite dated (more like a year in review style, with no depth). 3.) None of the interesting POV’s from social media names or Polymarket seem considered.  So nature of sources seems like purely long form written. Have you guys tried Firecrawl app? That seems like issue in your approach; how you are parsing and crawling in the first place.

Hey @MarkBasil Kaelen H. implemented exactly what was outlined in the Gdoc/brief,  even the exact prompt sequence you suggested.

Yes, we really like Firecrawl but what it does is very low level and basic: "here is a URL, give me the page contents"

No matter the approach we take the major challenges will still be:
• limited context windows (AI can only look at so much content at once while still accurately following our instructions)
• challenges with scraping protected content (~1/3rd of the sources listed are restricted from bots/scraping)
• models' tendency to generate average rather than nuanced insights (requires many hours of iteration and prompt engineering)
Should we do a quick call do discuss these challenges and next steps? @Vicky

I think we are at an impasse for the moment.

We will wind down the contract.  What you guys delivered is less fullsome then what we already have access too.  Much obliged for your efforts.

@MarkBasil I understand. It upsets me that we weren't able to deliver something that was to your satisfaction. Perhaps we were too optimistic in what we could deliver given the capabilities/limitations of AI systems and budget constrains.

Assuming that ChatGPT Deep Research is what you are comparing to, I get why anything we build in 20 or even 80 hours won't satisfy - I don't think there is *any* product on the market that is anywhere as good. and is why its behind the $200/mo plan

Anyway, it was really nice getting to know you and everyone on your team, and I think it would have been an interesting problem to work on - hope that we are able to work together in the future.

thank you @DavidSodaman  @KaelenH. @ClayBell for the hard work on this over the past weeks. As Mark Basil mentioned, we'll wrap the project at this point. As initially discussed, we'll handle billing / payment via upwork. Please share an invoice / wrap report at your earliest convenience
